## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->


’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
      And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
      The frumious Bandersnatch!”

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In twilight's embrace, a tale unfurls,  
Where whispers dance and secrets twirl.  
Silent stars, like lanterns ignite,  
Painting the canvas of endless night.  

Through fields of dreams, a river meanders,  
Its waters caress the soul's soft surrender.  
Where sunbeams blend with gentle breeze,  
Nature's symphony brings hearts to ease.  

A traveler roams on paths unknown,  
Seeking solace in places yet to be shown.  
Footprints linger, marking the way,  
A pilgrimage to a brighter day.  
In laughter's embrace, bonds are formed,  
Love's tapestry, beautifully adorned.  
Shared moments bloom like blossoms rare,  
With fragrant petals, a love affair.  

Upon the stage, a dancer glides,  
Bound by rhythm, her spirit guides.  
A graceful waltz, a leap of grace,  
She weaves a story in twirling space.
